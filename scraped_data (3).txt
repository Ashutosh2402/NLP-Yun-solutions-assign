Reliance demerger and family feud
[
edit
]
The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL.
[111]
 Since its inception, the company was managed by its founder and chairman 
Dhirubhai Ambani
. After suffering a stroke in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of the company to his sons 
Mukesh Ambani
 and 
Anil Ambani
. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of the company was taken up by both the brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having differences with his brother Anil over 'ownership issues'.
[112]
 He also said that the differences \"are in the private domain\". The share prices 
[113]
 of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal splitting the RIL group business into two parts.
[114]
 In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalised. Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received telecom, power, entertainment, and financial services business of the group. The 
Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
 includes Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Power.
[115]
[116]
The division of Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in de-merger of 4 businesses from RIL.
[117]
[118]
 These businesses immediately became part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies.
[32]

ONGC
 moved to 
Delhi High Court
 accusing RIL of pilferage of 18 billion cubic metres of gas from its gas-producing block in the

.
[121]
 Subsequently, the two companies agreed to form an independent expert panel to probe any pilferage.
[122]

Nusli Wadia
, the exposes by the 
Indian Express
 and Arun Shourie about illegal imports by the company and overseas share transactions by shell companies, and the botched attempt to acquire 
Larsen & Toubro
.
[123]
As early as 1996, 
Outlook
 magazine addressed other controversies related to fake and switched shares; insider trading; and a nexus with the state-owned 
Unit Trust of India
. Five main allegations concerning Reliance, which have plunged the Indian capital markets into a period of uncertainty unsurpassed since the days of the securities scam were:
Reliance issued fake shares.
It switched shares sent for transfer by buyers to make illegal profits.
It indulged in insider trading in shares.
It established a nexus with the Unit Trust of India to raise huge sums of money to the detriment of UTI subscribers.
It attempted to monopolize the private telecom services market through front companies.

2005 Criminal investigation
[

The 
Central Bureau of Investigation
 (CBI) filed a charge sheet in a Mumbai court against Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and four retired employees of 
National Insurance Company Limited
 (NICL), including a former CMD, under provisions of the 
Prevention of Corruption Act
 for 
criminal conspiracy
 and other charges. Acting on a reference from CVC in March 2005, the CBI started probing the conspiracy that led to the filing of the charge sheet on 9 December 2011. The 2005 complaint had alleged irregularities in the issuance of insurance policies \u2014 for coverage of default payments \u2014 by NICL to RIL. The charge sheet also mentioned criminal offenses with dishonest intention and causing wrongful loss totaling \u20b9147.41 crores to NICL and wrongful gain to the private telecom provider.

Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin gas controversy
[
edit
]
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was supposed to relinquish 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in 2004 and 2005, as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). However, the entire block was declared as a discovery area and RIL was allowed to retain it. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) criticized the Oil Ministry for this decision. The CAG also faulted RIL for limiting the competition in contracts, stating that RIL awarded a $1.1 billion contract to Aker on a single-bid basis.

[126]
Petition against Reliance Jio
[
edit
]
A PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation, through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of a pan-India license to RJIL by the Government of India. The PIL alleged that RJIL was allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying an additional fee of just INR 16,580 million (US$280 million) which was arbitrary and unreasonable and contributed to a loss of INR 228,420 million (US$3.8 billion) to the exchequer.
[127]
[128]
The CAG in its draft report alleged rigging of the auction mechanism, whereby an unknown ISP, Infotech Broadband Services Pvt Ltd, acquired the spectrum by bidding 5000 times its net worth, after which the company was sold to Reliance Industries.
[129]
Future Retail deal and possession
[
edit
]
In February 2022, Reliance terminated the leases of hundreds of Future Retail locations, the next largest retail chain in India, and took possession of those brick-and-mortar shops. Future Retail had a deal to sell its assets to Reliance, but that deal was contested by 
Amazon.com
, which in 2019 acquired a stake in a subunit of Future Retail along with certain rights with respect to the transfer of the retailer's assets. Reliance's possessions came after rounds of legal wrangling, including a 2020 arbitration in Singapore and an antitrust review by the 
Competition Commission of India
.
[130]
[131]
[132]
[133]
Stock manipulation and penalty
[
edit
]
For manipulating shares of 
Reliance Petroleum
 Limited (RPL), Reliance Industries was fined Rs. 950 crore (about 447 crore in retracted gains and 500 crore in interest) in 2007.
[16]
 In April 2006, RPL went public as a Reliance subsidiary at a price of Rs. 60 per share. The market crashed by 30% after it floated at roughly Rs. 100, and RPL was back at 60. In accordance with 
Securities and Exchange Board of India
 directive, RIL carried out an organised operation with the help of its agents in order to obtain unauthorised profits from the trading of its formerly listed unit, RPL, which was combined with the former in 2009.

MUMBAI: 
Qwik Supply Chain
, a little known company, has emerged as the third-largest buyer of 
electoral bonds
 at Rs 410 crore with at least two 
directors
 of the firm linked to some entities of 
Reliance Industries Ltd
 (RIL). 
A RIL spokesperson, however, said Qwik Supply Chain is not a subsidiary of any Reliance entity.
Among the three directors of Qwik Supply Chain, Tapas Mitra holds directorships in 26 other companies, while Vipul Mehta is associated with eight additional entities.
Mitra's directorships include partnership firms such as Reliance Eros Productions LLP and corporations such as Jamnagar Kandla Pipeline Company Private Limited, which shares an address with several other Reliance entities in Ahmedabad. Mitra, who identifies himself as the Head of Accounts at Reliance Industries on LinkedIn, oversees accounts and commercial operations across various companies within the group.
Another director at Qwik Supply Chain is Mahesh Mungekar, who also holds directorial roles at Reliance Group entities like Reliance Telecom and Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited.
The 
shareholders
 receiving bonus shares include Reliance Fire Brigade Services Private Limited, Reliance Group Support Services Private Limited, Vibrant Advertising Private Limited, Imaginationworks Production Company Private Limited, Reliance Hospital Management Services Private Limited, and Gujarat Petcoke and Petroproducts Supply Private Limited, data showed.
During the fiscal year 2021-22, the company's 
political contributions
 amounted to Rs 360 crore, while some reports said its net profit stood was only Rs 21.7 crore. In the subsequent year, an additional Rs 50 crore was donated.
On Nov 28, 2022, the company's board passed a resolution to allocate 
bonus equity shares
 to existing shareholders. This resolution authorised the issuance of 12,95,43,000 bonus equity shares, valued at Rs 10 each, from the company's profit and loss account. Shareholders will receive these shares in a ratio of 290:1, resulting in a capital increase of Rs 129,54,30,000.
Furthermore, the board empowered Tapas Mitra, Vikram Misra, and Vipul Mehta, as well as any one director of the company, to undertake necessary actions related to the allotment of bonus equity shares.

Electoral bonds data: 
Reliance Industries on Friday denied links with Qwik Supply Chain Private Limited, the third largest donor to political parties using electoral bonds. A spokesperson of Reliance made it clear that Qwik Supply Chain, which has its registered address at Navi Mumbai's Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City (DAKC), is not the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's subsidiary.\u00a0
 
   The development came a day after Qwik Supply Chain was ranked as the third largest donor to political parties using electoral bonds on a list released by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday.
 
Electoral Bonds Data Live updates
\"Qwik Supply Chain Pvt Ltd is not a subsidiary of any Reliance entity,\" the spokesperson of 
Reliance Industries
 said.
 
 
 
 
   Many political observers expressed surprise when the name of India's largest company, Reliance Industries, was not found on the list of donor companies in the electoral bonds data. But soon, the Mukesh Ambani-led company was linked with Qwik Supply Chain Private Limited.
 
Qwik Supply Chain
 purchased electoral bonds worth  
\u20b9
410 crore between financial years 2021-22 and 2023-24 and was ranked third highest donor after Future Gaming and Hotel Services ( 
\u20b9
1,368 crore) and Megha Engineering ( 
\u20b9
966 crore).
   The Navi Mumbai-based company was registered in November 2000 with an authorised share capital of  
\u20b9
130.99 crore. As per publicly available information about Qwik Supply Chain, it makes 
warehouses and storage units
. In FY22-23, the company earned  
\u20b9
500 crore in revenue, but the profit details of the Qwik Supply Chain are not public.
 
Reliance Industries-Qwik Supply Chain link
The top officials of the Qwik Supply Chain link the company with Reliance Industries. Qwik Supply Chain has three directors on its board with Tapas Mitra being the longest-serving director. Tapas Mitra also sits on the board of 25 other companies like Reliance Eros Productions LLP and companies like Jamnagar Kandla Pipeline Company Private Limited.
   Moreover, the 
Jamnagar Kandla Pipeline
 is an Ahmedabad-registered company and its address is shared by some other Reliance companies like Reliance Paging Private Limited, Jamnagar Ratlam Pipeline Private Limited, Reliance Tankages Private Limited, and Reliance Oil and Petroleum Private Limited.
   Another company named Honeywell Properties Private Limited on the list of electoral bond donors is being linked with Reliance Industries through its director Satyanarayanamurthy Veera Venkata Korlep. He has been serving on the boards of several Reliance group firms since 2005.
   Honeywell Properties Private Limited donated  
\u20b9
30 crore to political parties through electoral bonds.

Reliance-linked company among top 10?
Qwik Supply Chain Private Limited, a little-known company with registered address at Navi Mumbai's Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City (DAKC) and having links to Reliance Industries, was the third largest donor to political parties using electoral bonds. It bought Rs 410 crore of electoral bonds between financial years 2021-22 and 2023-24 but Reliance said the company is not a subsidiary of any Reliance entity. A Reliance Industries spokesperson in response to a detailed questionnaire, said: \"Qwik Supply Chain Pvt Ltd is not a subsidiary of any Reliance entity.\" However, one of the directors at the company, Tapas Mitra, is a director of partnership firms such as Reliance Eros Productions LLP and companies like Jamnagar Kandla Pipeline Company Private Limited. Jamnagar Kandla Pipeline is registered in Ahmedabad at an address shared by some other Reliance companies.

                                                    Published 15.03.24, 09:41 AM

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said on Thursday it has agreed to buy Paramount Global's entire 13.01 per cent stake in local entertainment network Viacom 18 Media for about Rs 4,286 crore.
The announcement comes days after RIL, Viacom18 and The Walt Disney Company (Disney) sewed up a deal to form a joint venture. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63.16 per cent \u2014 16.34 per cent by Reliance and 46.82 per cent by Viacom18 \u2014 and the rest by Disney.

The effective stake of Reliance will now rise after the deal with Paramount.
In a regulatory filing, RIL said it has signed a binding agreement with two subsidiaries of Paramount Global to acquire a 13.01 per cent equity stake of Viacom 18 held by Paramount.
At the same time, Paramount Global said the closure is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals as well as the completion of the joint venture among Reliance, Viacom18 and Star Disney.
Viacom18 has 40 television channels, including Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV.
Paramount said it will continue to license its content to Viacom18 after the closing of the deal. It already streams its content through Reliance's JioCinema.
RIL said it holds compulsorily convertible preference shares of Viacom18 representing a 57.48 per cent equity stake on a fully diluted basis. Post the completion of this transaction, the company's equity stake in Viacom18 will increase to 70.49 per cent on a fully diluted basis.
As part of the Reliance-Disney deal, the media undertaking of Viacom18 would be merged with Star India Pvt Ltd (SIPL) through a court-approved scheme of arrangement. Reliance had also agreed to invest Rs 11,500 crore in the joint venture.
The merger of the Indian operations of Disney with Reliance comes amid the failed amalgamation of Sony and Zee in February that could have created a $10 billion giant.
Shares of Reliance on Thursday ended sideways at Rs 2,865.25 on the BSE.
Tata Play
The Tata group is reportedly planning to buy Walt Disney Company\u2019s stake in Tata Play which will give it full control of the satellite television broadcaster.
A Bloomberg report on Thursday said the companies have held preliminary talks to buy Disney\u2019s significant minority stake which will value Tata Play at about $1 billion.
If the deal goes through, it will be the second big transaction for the Burbank, California-based giant that merged its media operations in India with Reliance. This transaction announced late last month valued the joint venture at $8.5 billion.
The latest buzz follows another recent report which said Reliance is eyeing Disney\u2019s nearly 30 per cent stake in Tata Play.
Tata Sons holds a little over 50 per cent in the broadcaster with the rest being held by Disney and Singapore\u2019s Temasek, which has a 20 per cent share.
Temasek was in discussions with the Tata group last year to sell its stake.
Tata Play was in the news in 2022 when it became the first company in the country to adopt the pre-filing route for a proposed initial public offering (IPO).
For the year ended March 31, 2023, Tata Play which competes against giants such as Netflix, JioCinema, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar had reported a loss of Rs 105 crore on revenues of almost Rs 4,500 crore.

Advisory Alert:
